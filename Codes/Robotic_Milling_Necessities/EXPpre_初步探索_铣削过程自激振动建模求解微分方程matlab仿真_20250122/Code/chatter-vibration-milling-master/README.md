# Modelling of chatter vibration in thin-wall milling and its effect on surface roughness of job


This project was a part of the Production Techniques-2 course at my university. The aim was to write shum kind ofh MATLAB script to simulate the chatter vibrations. The phenomenon for a 2-DOF model is represented by a second order **Delay Differential Equation**. With absolutely no clue on how to solve DDEs and minimal resources available, I had to reverse engineer the example codes and understand the documentation.

Also I raised a question on MATLAB forum if you wanna look at it.
